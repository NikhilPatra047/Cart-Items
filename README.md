# Cart-Items
A dummy project that replicates the cart section of any e-commerce website.

The project has the feature to let the users increment and decrement the number of items that they want to buy, clear the cart, or remove individual items. 
Based on the number of items that one wants to buy, the total price of purchase and the total amount of items to be bought is then reflected in the webpage. 

The whole project is created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
